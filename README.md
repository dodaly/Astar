# Astar
finds optimal path from start node to goal node with randomly generated "wall" nodes

This was the 4th major project from my intro to AI class.
the project was interesting because A* is one of the primary pathfinding algorithms in games, as well as gps apps

one of the struggles i remember with this project was really just getting the algorithm to work.
I remember tinkering with the numbers and order of things for a while. then finally understanding what i was doing wrong and fixing it

I had a lot of fun with this project because i remember trying to help my classmates get through it 
and seeing the other approaches it was possible to take with this project such as recursion
